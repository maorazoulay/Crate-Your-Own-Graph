Clicking on a vertex to-be-moved will highlight it in green and then a second click somewhere else will move it there.

# Add Edge:

Selecting vertex a will highlight it in green, then selecting vertex b will create a blue stroke from vertex a to b.
  
# Remove edge:

Selecting an edge or clicking next to it will remove it.
  
# Add All Edges:

This will add every possible edge between all vertices on the canvas.
  
# Show Connected Components:
